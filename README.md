# The Project description

The main purpose of the website is:

- To make clear for users that the website is dedicated to live piano music concerts lovers community.
- To provide users with easy navigation throughout the website.

# UX
The purpose is to design a landing page with a large screen and mobile approach for making navigation fast and efficient.
The user should have the possibility to navigate easily to get the maximum of the needed information on what they are going to listen at the concerts, what location the concerts are held, the schedules of the concerts, who are the founders and music performers, how they can know more details on schedule, how they can attend the concert (through booking or drop-in), how they can reach out the team for inquiries or suggestions.
The landing page is separated into several sections, including the header and the footer. 
Target Audience
The landing page is aimed but not limited to the following users:
- People who live in Stockholm or Sweden and want to have an opportunity to listen to live piano music.
- Guests to Stockholm, who want to attend a cultural event in the city.

# Design

Colour Scheme
- The main colors used throughout the landing page are: white, red(#e30134), dark- grey(#12151F) and light-grey(#696969). To use this range of colors i got inspired by the [Royal Academy of Music](https://www.ram.ac.uk/).
- The first the user sees when opens the landing page is the “Home” page with the main message for visitors, the navigation bar with the navigation menu, and the footer with contact details. For the “Home” page i used a black and white background hero image with the playing piano man to show that the landing page is related to music.
- Together with the dark gray navbar and footer, the opaque overlay effect of the photo, gives the page simplicity, style and conveys the mood of a cozy concert time. At the same time, the logo (on the left of the navigation bar), navigation links and the main text in white, as well as the red button give freshness and highlight the main message for the user.
- For the “How it works?” section i used red and white colors to highlight important information about the place, the time of the concerts and the place where the detailed information about the playlist can be obtained.
- The “Who we are?” section is executed with the light-grey background, dark-grey heading and founders names, white description of the team goals and their functions int the project. These colors highlight the section and make the content easy to understand and read.
- The “Book your spot” section with the implemented booking form is executed in red, light-grey, dark-grey and white colors. This gives consistency and balance to the entire landing page. 

## Typography
The Exo font is the main font used throughout the landing page with Sans Serif as the fallback font. It is easy to read, stylish font, with a touch of exclusivity that users will surely appreciate.

## Imagery
The large, background hero image is designed to convey the main message, catch the user's attention and bring them to the cozy environment of the piano concerts. As noted above, the photo is selected in black and white with an opaque overlay effect, which gives it some exclusivity.
The founders/performers images are also used to make to introduce users to those who organized the project and who will play the concerts.

    a.	This information can be easily found by scrolling down to the section “How it works?” under the title ”What we play?” or choosing the internal link “How it works?” in the navigation menu.

## Further Testing
-	The landing page was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-	The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone 8, Xiaomi Mi Note 10, Xiaomi Note 10 Pro.
-	A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all internal/external links work correctly.
-	Friends and family members were asked to review the landing page to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
## Known Bugs
-	During joint testing of the deployed landing page with my mentor, the images of the project founders / pianists did not appear, although when opening ports from the Gitpod, no issues occured. This happened due to the fact that I indicated the relative path to images in the code. After my mentor recommended to change the path to absolute, the problem was resolved.
-	After the mentioned above error was resolved, while testing the landing page in different browsers, I noticed that in Internet Explorer, images of team members open in a distorted form: they are stretched and corners appear instead of a round shape, but after a few minutes the images are displayed correctly.
-	While testing the landing page using Developer Tools in the Google Chrome, I noticed that on smartphones and tablets there is a space on the right side between the footer and other sections, except for the navigation bar. I tested the landing page on my smartphone and noticed the same problem. I also asked my friends and family to test the landing page on their smartphones. As a result, everyone had the same problem. During the third session with my mentor, we found out that in the header code I used an extra Bootstrap class row and “col-md-12” instead of “col-12”, what as a result affected the responsiveness. After I edited the code, the problem was resolved. Thus, the landing page looks correct on all types of devices.
-	After testing the landing page by my friends and family, they pointed out that the external link to twitter in the footer did not work. I also tested the following link and got the same problem. I double-checked the code and found out that instead of “https:” I wrote “hrrps:”. After editing the code, the link worked correctly.
-	After testing the landing page by my friends and family, they recommended to:  

    a. Remove the gray filter from the founders / pianist images as it makes the page less vivid.  

    b. Place the “Book your spot!” button below the word "drop-in", as it would be more logical if I want to call for an action.  

-	After testing the landing page using the W3C Markup and W3C CSS Validators, an error was found in CSS syntax: I incorrectly used an extra space between the number of pixels and the pixel sign. After I removed the space, the validator showed that I had no errors.
-	After testing the landing page using the W3C Markup and W3C CSS Validators, one error was found in HTML syntax:  

    a.	The syntax of the button in the header was incorrect. Anchor tag could not be placed inside the button. After i resctructured the button  as <a href=”sign-up” class=”btn btn-danger” role=”button”> the error was resolved.  

    b.	After that, some warnings appeared but no errors.
