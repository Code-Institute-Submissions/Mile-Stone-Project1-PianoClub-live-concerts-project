# Design Process
The first step of the design process was based on the target audience's description, user story and the key features i wanted to provide on the landing page for intuitive navigation. Thus, i decided to implement several sections: “Home”, “How it works?”, “Who we are?”, “Book your spot”. In addition, i decided to add a navigation bar with the navigation menu and a footer with contacts. The original design changed slightly during the code generation, but not critical.

# Design

Colour Scheme
- The main colors used throughout the landing page are: white, red(#e30134), dark- grey(#12151F) and light-grey(#696969). To use this range of colors i got inspired by the Royal Academy of Music (https://www.ram.ac.uk/).
- The first the user sees when opens the landing page is the “Home” page with the main message for visitors, the navigation bar with the navigation menu, and the footer with contact details. For the “Home” page i used a black and white background hero image with the playing piano man to show that the landing page is related to music.
- Together with the dark gray navbar and footer, the opaque overlay effect of the photo, gives the page simplicity, style and conveys the mood of a cozy concert time. At the same time, the logo (on the left of the navigation bar), navigation links and the main text in white, as well as the red button give freshness and highlight the main message for the user.
- For the “How it works?” section i used red and white colors to highlight important information about the place, the time of the concerts and the place where the detailed information about the playlist can be obtained.
- The “Who we are?” section is executed with the light-grey background, dark-grey heading and founders names, white description of the team goals and their functions int the project. These colors highlight the section and make the content easy to understand and read.
- The “Book your spot” section with the implemented booking form is executed in red, light-grey, dark-grey and white colors. This gives consistency and balance to the entire landing page. 

## Typography
The Exo font is the main font used throughout the landing page with Sans Serif as the fallback font. It is easy to read, stylish font, with a touch of exclusivity that users will surely appreciate.

## Imagery
The large, background hero image is designed to convey the main message, catch the user's attention and bring them to the cozy environment of the piano concerts. As noted above, the photo is selected in black and white with an opaque overlay effect, which gives it some exclusivity.
The founders/performers images are also used to make to introduce users to those who organized the project and who will play the concerts. For the photos, I used a 20% gray filter to avoid too much sharp contrast with the gray background.

# Features
